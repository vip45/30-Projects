        <p>
          Infrastructure fuels transformation, and tier 2 cities like Mohali and
          Zirakpur are prime examples. The PR‑7 Airport Road links these cities
          to Chandigarh International Airport, cutting travel time and boosting
          property values. Since 2023, land along this corridor has appreciated
          by ~10% annually.
        </p>
        <p>
          The expansion of the Shaheed Bhagat Singh International Airport and
          the upcoming metro connecting Mohali, Chandigarh, and Panchkula will
          drive even higher returns. These improvements aren&apos;t just for
          mobility, they redefine urban convenience.
        </p>
        <p>
          As per data, nearly 44% of the 3,294 acres acquired by developers in
          2024 were in tier 2 and 3 cities, reaffirming confidence in regional
          growth.
